Project Overview: Simple Blog Application
Objective:
Develop a full-stack blog application where users can create, view, edit, and delete blog posts.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js with Express.js
Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)
Other Tools/Libraries: Mongoose (for MongoDB interaction), Axios (for API requests), React Router (for navigation)
Key Features:
Blog Post Management:

Create Posts: Users can create new blog posts with a title and content.
View Posts: All blog posts are displayed on the main page with the title and a snippet of the content.
Edit Posts: Users can edit their existing blog posts.
Delete Posts: Users can delete their blog posts.
User Interface:

Home Page: Displays a list of all blog posts with options to view, edit, or delete.
Post Page: Allows users to view a single blog post in detail.
Create/Edit Page: Forms to create new blog posts or edit existing ones.
Backend:

API Endpoints:
GET /api/posts: Retrieve all blog posts.
GET /api/posts/:id: Retrieve a single blog post by its ID.
POST /api/posts: Create a new blog post.
PUT /api/posts/:id: Update an existing blog post.
DELETE /api/posts/:id: Delete a blog post by its ID.
Data Management: MongoDB is used to store and manage blog post data, with Mongoose for easy data manipulation.
Routing:

React Router is used to handle navigation between different pages of the application, such as viewing all posts, creating a new post, and editing or deleting an existing post.
Additional Notes:
Authentication: (Optional) You can add user authentication to ensure only authorized users can create, edit, or delete posts.
Styling: Use CSS or a library like Bootstrap for styling the application.
Deployment: The application can be deployed using platforms like Heroku (for the backend) and Netlify or Vercel (for the frontend).
This project demonstrates a solid understanding of full-stack development using the MERN stack, from setting up the server and API endpoints to building a responsive and interactive user interface.
